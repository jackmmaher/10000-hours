mud8sr,I will share with you the secret trick to stopping inner monologue.,"Hello everyone,

I've been meditating/trying to meditate for over 12 years and could never rein in my turbulent inner monologue. It never stopped for more than a few seconds at most and I even started believing that it was not supposed to. But that would make concentration meditation impossible, and we know that it isn't.

Anyway, here's the information for all of you, with love:

_focusing on peripheral vision stops inner monologue_

Look anywhere, softly. Gently focus on what you see in the corners of your eyes. That's it!

There's no mention of this apart from in one book I found and like, one old study about hypnosis techniques, but focusing on peripheral vision apparently engages the parasympathetic nervous system, calms you down and stops internal monologue.

I hope this helps many people.

Edit: Thanks for the feedback, love reading all the comments. It makes me happy that so many people found use of this! 🙏",SamathaTRUTH,4380,370,2021-04-20T00:16:53,https://reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/mud8sr/i_will_share_with_you_the_secret_trick_to/,0.99,Sharing/Insight

i7h6b7,The rise in popularity in mindfulness and meditation is not a coincidence. We live in some of the most unfulfilling and disconnected of times.,"If you live life totally unconcious and ""asleep"", modern 1st world societies are so devoid of deep connections, moments of peace, quiet, slow contemplation, that one easily grows desperate for something they don't even understand they need. I think the epidemic of depression and anxiety in the west is very much a symptom of this.

We live lives of sound bites, tweets, likes, visual and sensoral  overstimulation; for everything else is so dull by comparison. There is such a lack of quiet comtemplative acceptance. Everything is surface level, we have an ocean of experiences to feast on 2mm deep. Everything is done to an extreme, gaudy, loud, excessive. Anything to drown out the quiet whisper in the background ""there is nothing here"". 

We are unconciously drowning in despair and longing for even the smallest bit of peace, quiet, present acceptance of the now. For our own self found meaning, self forged purpose that is free of external dependencies. 

Instead we chase a million unsatisfactory likes, validations, affirmations. Modern society has made drug addicts of all of us, itching and yearning for that next hit. Uncomfortable in our very skin, clawing to get out. Love me, like me, give me hapiness, distract me, titalate me, numb me. Anything to not need.

Every generation of human beings on this planet of course has struggled with presence. But no society in history has been born into such a deluge of sense numbing disconnection from the things that bring real peace. Nature, sun, the rain, a quiet walk at night, the sound of birds, an hour alone, peace, even feeling our negative emotions we numb. Crying can be so cathartic.  We are so scared to feel.",eulersidentity1,3557,120,2020-08-11T01:17:29,https://reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/i7h6b7/the_rise_in_popularity_in_mindfulness_and/,0.98,Sharing/Insight

80engg,"Time to ban the posting of how long you have meditated, if it doesn't contain any accompanying experiences, learnings or tips.","Many have shown irritation at the amount of posts that simply show screenshots of members’ time spent in meditation with the help of meditation apps.

The habit or desire of showing one’s meditation achievements simply through score keeping is sometimes commendable, as it can help encourage members. But mostly it looks like members just want to some karma or praises and good feelings as positive comments flow in.

1h76yqp,I've been meditating for over 30 years. These are 3 BIG mistakes I've seen people make. ,"There are a lot of ungrounded, floaty, wannabe-holy people out there. Please don't be one of them. 

I started meditating as a way to cope with my unstable upbringing and to quell the very confusing ""psychic"" experiences I was having, where I could seemingly predict what was going to happen before it did. I grew up in a scientific household and didn't believe in ""woo-woo"" spiritual ideas (little did I know!). 

I started with simple guided meditations, and graduated to more specific techniques like Mindfulness, Vipassana, and Transcendental Meditation. In every meditation community I dove into, there was always a strong subset of people who treated the technique like a religion: unquestioning devotion (which is valuable), with complete suspension of critical thinking and skepticism (not as valuable). 

So to start: 

Mistake 1) They treat meditation like a religion.   
  
Here's what's going to happen: You're going to get benefits from meditation, a lot of benefits, and then you're going to erroneously believe that EVERYONE must do what you have done, because it worked for you. 

Everyone has their own path, and it is the correct path because it is THEIR path. Don't develop a dogmatic relationship to the practice. It worked for you because you were ready for it, and it won't work for your friend because that's not what they need at this point of their journey. Support people's path, without projecting your own onto them. 

Mistake 2) They believe they are a saint, spirit, or soul living a physical experience. 

You're very much a human being, with many tens of thousands of years of biological evolution literally in your veins and in every one of your cells. Honor the process, and honor your context and roots. I saw many people wanting to force an ideal of enlightenment onto their physical being. Stop it. Just be, because that's enough, and living is already a cosmic experience (literally, because we're flying among stars).

1os2dnk,I was unhappy with my sex life. I did some meditation. It was very frightening.,"I was very unhappy with myself. I had absolutely no sex life. I would go to night clubs and bars across the world and would fail miserably at ""scoring"". I only had one relationship that lasted for 3 years. I initiated it very awkwardly. My ex was Extremely kind and patient at first. It ended very very badly. I won't discuss that topic further. ​For years I allowed all the negative emotions to fester in me. I would remember the hurtful things my ex said ""too little too late"". I would beat myself over it into misery. I knew if I continued down this path that I would die alone with hardly anyone to remember me. So I decided to sit down and meditate one day and not to get up until I resolve my problems. Not unlike the buddha. It took me hours then it hit me like a wave. I felt relief and I cried. Basically I realized that deep down I am a good and intelligent person. I simply did not believe in my self. I was simply unable to stand up for myself. I allowed people's criticisms even positive heartfelt ones to consume my mind. Upon this realization. I decided to practice being kind to people especially women and expect nothing in return. It felt good. I decided to pick back up the guitar. That felt good. Ignoring people when they say bad things about me. That felt good. Flirting with women. That felt good. For the first time in since i was small child i felt happy! this feeling is also frightening. Like stepping into the unknown. People at work thought I was being crazy or I was high. No for once I am at peace!!! I have clarity.

j1ubwn,8 Uncomfortable lessons that we all need to learn,"1. Your self-love must be stronger than your desire to be loved:

If you're not happy now, there's no amount of followers, positive social media comments, or Instagram likes that will change that. External validation isn't happiness - it's a
hamster wheel. Validation is an inside job. The most convincing sign that someone is truly living their ""best life"", is their lack of desire to show the world that they're living their best life.
Your ""best life"" won't seek external validation, but insecurity continually will.

2. You are always responsible for your emotional reactions:

If you get angry and say ""X thing made me angry"", you will get angry often.
If you get angry and say: ""I made myself angry because of X thing"" you will get angry less often.
All of your emotional responses are your
fault and responsibility. Nothing can make you angry. Your thoughts about what
happened made you angry. That's on you. If you realize that, you'll have the power to control it. If you don't, you'll spend your life triggered easily and unhappy often.

3. Don't feed your problems with thoughts, starve them with action:

If you want to feed a problem, keep thinking about it.
If you want to starve a problem, take action.
Most of the harm starts in your mind, with you and your thoughts.
Most of the solutions start with a decision, courage, and action.

4. Life has an algorithm too:

Just like social media has algorithms to give you more of what you're interested in, life has an algorithm that gives you more of what
you're thinking about and focusing on. You can train your algorithm to make you more anxious, worried, or insecure by focusing on negative things.
You can train your algorithm for happiness, success, and growth by focusing on positive things.
Your thoughts become your decisions and then your actions your focus becomes your future.

5. If they're real,
they'll want to see you win:

1ftrrpf,I did 5-6 hours a day of yoga and meditation for 3 years - this is what I learned,"So I had some mental issues and went ahead with yoga and meditation to better them. At this time I started 5-6 hours a day of some of the practices Sadh-guru teaches.

The first thing I have learned is people (including myself) are almost always in a state of unease - meaning their mind has to be constantly occupied, fidgeting with various things all the time. Few people can actually look you in the eyes and just be there with you in that moment. Everyone has a mind that is all over the place with compulsions to do this and that. Here is where my practice drasticly improved this condition for me. The compulsibe need to keep the mind occopied at all times went almost intirely away. Istead I just started paying attention to whatever was there - looking at things without being consumed by them. This also improves productivty by a lot.

Secondly, a sense of abandon and desirelessness has come. I can simply sit with my eyes closed for an hour and just enjoy that without the need to stimulate my brain. There is a whole inner world where one can access very blisful states. You can access this if your body and mind becomes more still and less compulsive. When you are in touch with the inner stilness, it is hard for you to be truly bothered by anything, because at the core of who you are there is always a sense of peace.

Lastly, the sense of inner freedom and joy that has come is priceless. The smallest things like going for a walk in the forest or looking at the sky can bring joy. Nothing fancy thing to fulfill the list of endless desires is really needed anymore. Relations have reduced in numbers, but those that remain are much deeper and more fulfilling.

These are some of the things that have happened. I'm curious to hear your own experiences with meditation and yoga.",Rich_Shock_7206,2100,247,2024-10-01T17:06:14,https://reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1ftrrpf/i_did_56_hours_a_day_of_yoga_and_meditation_for_3/,0.98,Sharing / Insight 💡

I couldn't stop thoughts from coming into my head (I know this isn't what you're supposed to do lol) so I thought it would be funny to think about EVERYTHING at once (like literally every thought possible simultaneously). 

And when I do, my mind goes completely blank. Like at most just me being aware that I'm not thinking about anything. Maybe this is already a known thing, but it works every time I do it. Does this work for anybody else? Or am I just a quack?

8ieh89,"I used to ""suck"" at meditating. My mind would wander the entire time or I'd give up halfway through. Now I meditate for close to an hour a day. Here's what's helped me stick to meditation over the last 5 years.","Hi r/meditation. Are any of these you?

""My thoughts won't stop.""

""This is so damn boring.""

""I can't tell if it's working.""

This was me 5 years ago. Around this time, I was a stressed, anxious dude working in a corporate environment, which only made me even more stressed and anxious. I smoked almost everyday, and I worried all the time about inconsequential things (like what people thought of me or times I failed).

Years later, meditation has helped me let go of anxiety, worry less, be more present/confident (among many many other things). It's been so valuable that I've been trying to learn as much as possible so that I can one day teach this stuff to others. 

These are things that have helped me make meditation a regular practice in my life.

###1. We are building a muscle

When you do situps, you don't do 50 situps and expect your abs to look good. You don't even do situps for a week and expect them to look good. It's consistent exercise over long periods of time that will get you resuilts.

Meditation is the same, but most people give up as easily as they do with exercise, thinking that meditation ""doesn't work"" for them or that they ""can't do it."" I was the same.

But if you think of meditation like exercise, if you trust in the method, you know that if you put in the discipline, the time and the energy, you will get results. 

The challenge is just sticking to it.

Also like exercise, when you don't see ""results"" for weeks at a time, you can easily get discouraged and want to give up.

That brings us to our next step.


###2. Pick something specific to practice + make it useful

There are tons of meditation techniques out there. Candle meditation, body scans, noting thoughts, counting thoughts, focusing on the breath, etc. 

When I first started, I had so many techniques, I didn't know what to do with them -- So I forgot them all.

When I first learned Japanese, I ""learned"" a ton of phrases. And then when I went to Japan, I ended up ",Tamfail,2095,184,2018-05-10T13:27:18,https://reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/8ieh89/i_used_to_suck_at_meditating_my_mind_would_wander/,0.97,Sharing/Insight

1mym2ri,I started meditating 1 year ago. 500 hours later here is what actually happened,"A year ago, I was at complete rock bottom. Daily panic attacks, couldn't go to school, failed all my exams, severe insomnia where I'd stay awake for days. I was basically a shut-in (hikikomori) just lying in bed watching shows and gaming because I was in too much psychological pain to function. I had nothing left to lose, so I figured I'd try meditation.

**The progression:**

* September 2024: 14 minutes/day average
* Slowly built up to 30min, then 2x30min sessions
* February 2025: Joined a Zen community, averaging 1h 30min daily
* May 2025: Did my first retreat, then spiked to 4-5h daily average
* Current: Stable at 2+ hours daily, over 500 total hours accumulated

**What actually happened (the good):** My mental health is dramatically better. The panic attacks stopped. I can focus and concentrate in ways I never could before. My insomnia largely resolved. I went from barely functioning to planning to retake my high school exams and go to university.

**What actually happened (the unexpected):** This is where it gets weird, and nobody prepared me for this:

1. **I became more raw and honest** \- Not in a ""enlightened truth-teller"" way, but meditation stripped away my psychological defenses. I notice biases and thoughts I never wanted to admit I had. It's uncomfortable but probably necessary.
2. **I see suffering everywhere now** \- I feel deep sadness when I look at people rushing around, stressed, disconnected. Before meditation, I was too wrapped up in my own pain to notice others'. Now I see it clearly and it's overwhelming sometimes.
3. **My plans constantly get ""vaporized""** \- Every time I sit, elaborate future plans just... dissolve. I used to have detailed life strategies. Now I struggle to make long-term plans because they feel so obviously constructed and temporary.
4. **I became obsessed with wealth and power** \- This was the biggest surprise. I thought meditation would make me peaceful and detached from worldly things. Instead, I became laser-focused ",VeilOfReason,2059,484,2025-08-24T05:19:49,https://reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1mym2ri/i_started_meditating_1_year_ago_500_hours_later/,0.97,Sharing / Insight 💡
