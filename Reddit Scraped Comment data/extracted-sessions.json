Simply notice the subtle sensations of air moving in through your nostrils, the slight pause, and then the release of the exhale. Your breath has been doing this your entire life without any help from you.\n\nWhen you notice your mind has wandered - and it will, many times - simply acknowledge this with kindness and return to the breath. Each return is not a failure but a success. It's like doing a bicep curl for your attention.\n\nAfter a few minutes, take three deeper breaths, wiggle your fingers and toes, and gently open your eyes. You've just completed a meditation.

If you're not sure where you are, start over at one. There's no failure here - each restart is a moment of awakening, a recognition that the mind had wandered.\n\nDon't rush to get to ten. The goal isn't to count higher; it's to be completely present with each breath. One fully present breath is worth more than ten distracted ones.\n\nAs your concentration deepens over many sessions, you may find you need the counting less.

Your jaw - let it slacken. Your throat - release any tension held there.\n\nContinue down through your shoulders (let them melt into the bed), your arms (heavy and warm), your hands (fingers uncurling). Soften your chest, your belly, your lower back. Let your legs become heavy, your feet release.\n\nNow simply follow your breath. Don't try to do anything. Let the breath breathe itself. Let thoughts come and go without engagement. You're not going to solve any problems right now. You're not going to plan or remember. You're simply letting go, letting go, letting go.\n\nIf you're still awake, that's fine. Rest in the softness you've created. Sleep will come when it comes.",

Keep the gaze soft, directed downward at a 45-degree angle. This maintains alertness while still supporting inward focus.\n\nThird, adjust your posture. Sit taller. Lift the crown of the head toward the ceiling. Imagine a string pulling you upward. Drowsiness often increases when we slump.\n\nFourth, broaden your attention. Instead of focusing narrowly on the breath, expand awareness to include sounds, sensations throughout the body.

As you investigate, you may notice the restlessness changes or moves.\n\nRemember: you don't have to scratch every itch.

There is breath happening, and there is awareness of breath. Turn attention toward that awareness.\n\nNow let the breath do what it will - you're no longer directing attention to it. Instead, rest in the awareness that was knowing the breath. What is this awareness like? Does it have edges? A center? A location?\n\nYou may notice that awareness itself is spacious, clear, and unchanging - unlike the breath and thoughts which come and go. Rest in this recognition.\n\nIf the mind gets lost in thought, use the breath as a home base - return to it, stabilize, then let go again into open awareness.\n\nThis oscillation between focus and openness develops flexibility. Sometimes we need concentration; sometimes we need spaciousness. This practice cultivates both.\n\nClose by returning fully to breath awareness, then to body awareness, then slowly open your eyes.",

If nothing is present, continue with breath awareness.\n\nIf discomfort is present, bring attention directly to it. Instead of pulling away, lean in with curiosity. Where exactly is the sensation? What are its qualities - sharp, dull, throbbing, burning?\n\nNotice that 'pain' is a label. Underneath the label are raw sensations. Can you feel the sensations without the label? Without the story about them?\n\nBreath into the area of discomfort. Don't try to make it go away. Simply accompany it with awareness. You might silently say: 'I see you. I'm here with you.'\n\nYou may discover that pain observed closely begins to change - shifting location, intensity, quality. Sometimes it decreases. Sometimes it just becomes more workable.\n\nIf it becomes too intense, shift attention to a neutral area of the body, stabilize there, then return.\n\nClose by appreciating your willingness to be with difficulty.
