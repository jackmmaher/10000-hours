## App Store Description

### Short Description (for promotional text, 170 characters)

A beautiful meditation timer designed for the long journey to 10,000 hours. No subscriptions. No ads. Just practice.

### Full Description

**The meditation timer for serious practitioners.**

Still Hours is a beautifully minimal meditation timer built for one purpose: helping you build a lifelong practice. Track your journey toward 10,000 hours of meditation with a design that respects your time and attention.

**WHY STILL HOURS?**

Unlike subscription meditation apps that charge whether you practice or not, Still Hours uses a simple hour-based model. Purchase hours only when you need them. Your first hour is free.

**FEATURES**

- Elegant timer with breath-synchronized animations
- Progress tracking toward 10,000 hours
- Milestone achievements and celebrations
- Voice note insights after each session
- Session planning and reminders
- Full offline support - no internet required
- Dark and light themes
- No ads, no tracking, no subscriptions

**PRIVACY FIRST**

Your meditation data stays on your device. We don't track you, sell your data, or require sign-in to use the app. Community features (sharing insights) are completely optional.

**PAY FOR WHAT YOU USE**

- 1 free hour to start
- Hour packs from $0.99 (10 hours) to $7.99 (100 hours)
- Lifetime option ($99) for unlimited meditation

That's 6x cheaper per hour than typical meditation subscriptions, and you only pay for time you actually practice.

**THE JOURNEY**

10,000 hours is the path to mastery. Whether you're just starting or deepening an existing practice, Still Hours is your quiet companion on the way.

No destination. Just practice.
