# Business Model

## Identify a Massive App / Category

Like lifestyle, productivity, identify related apps for a given category within it.

## App Research

Use data scraping, mining and semantic analysis of the massive apps inside each of these identified categories, to triage their user base into 3–5 personas that account for 80% of their user base. Identify within the reviews and comments online by these personas, of their various ways in which they use the apps. Identify the 3 core benefits for each persona, and the three features that deliver these core benefits to them. Identify the 20% of features that drive 80% of app usage for each persona profile.

## Persona Identification

Select one of these personas to build a competitor app in. Deliver the core features better by making them the identity of our app, by designing everything around making them easier to use, more direct to use, more immediate to use. Any complementary feature or service or function within the app must deepen the value of the core feature set, not embellish them.

## App Design And Use Philosophy

Our apps must adopt the iceberg principle of design. That is, placing the user atop the slippery slope of an iceberg, poking out of the waves. Immediate use of the app, starts them off the peak, slipping quicker and quicker down its slope, discovering the app's depth and functionality and value with use. Competitor apps design using the mountain approach, placing new and existing users at the foot of a mountain, where they must first go through 20 onboarding pages, they are deeply encouraged to subscribe now to "save money", if not, they are presented with an app overtly designed to elicit subscription, free content is hidden, altogether, an insurmountable amount of friction is imposed. We must avoid this at all costs.

## No Third Party Dependents

All of our apps need to have no third party dependents in terms of suppliers that provide data, services or anything to make any app of ours work. So no third party api calls or costs. Local storage only, offline use, no cloud sync, no data capture, analytics, tracking.

## No Subscription Products

Our revenue model is this, we will having decided on the app, research our competitors products, how long the average user subscribes before deleting and cancelling a subscription, we will find out their average use of the app on a per session basis, per week, per month, number of sessions, to determine a global usage value expressed in minutes. We will compare this to the cost per year, deriving a price per hour value with which to then build out product offer around. Having determined this, we will determine a brilliant price to value equation where we offer a fixed number of hours use for our product, representing a "complete cycle" of use, for $.99 cent (excluding apple commission or $1.43 with). Upon completion a user, then has to pay another $.99 cent for another complete cycle use of the app as an In app purchase or "IAP". This allows all kinds of users to consume the app on a per price basis, that meets their budgets and their app habits. When prompted to pay for another cycle, users will be offered bulk hours in advance so if the initial cycle is 10 hour pack for $.99 cent, a user can then purchase 20hrs, 40hrs, 60hrs, etc up to 10,000hrs which is the equivalent of a lifetime purchase, for c. $79–$99 dollars. The complete cycle, bundle we offer, has to feel like a Starbucks Americano entry level coffee, vs our competitors. By this i mean, the amount of hours we give for the price per hour, relative to our competitor apps, has to equate or create the equation in our customers mind that size = value, that they are getting far more from us, then them.

Once the core cycle is completed, the user unlocks a completion modal popup, at the immediate point of pride, and solicits a rating + review, masquerading as "how do you feel right now" but in reality are App store review collection. 5 star rating pre-populated, and review text box prepopulated with placeholder text that essentially is a review "this app is exactly what I needed..." underneath three preset reviews, like a) Best meditation timer I've used b) So simple to use, straight forward and the price was great c) Looking forward to continuing using it.

**In app store** – Further revenue can be captured through an in app store, for expansion pack content, more hours, personalisation products, some of which will cost more than $.99 cent.

**Paywalls** – Once a cycle has been completed, an app becomes a historic "living artifact" of the work done to get there. If a user tries to continue to use the app, the paywall modal popups up, offering the various ways new cycles, of varying sizes and lengths can be purchased to continue the apps use.

## Marketing And Distribution

Each app developed for given personas, will try to have an ecosystem built around them of complementary apps that such persona's will enjoy. Doing so will allow us to perform in app cross promotion of other apps to those users, from the same who brought you this app, here are 3–5 more.

Each app developed for given personas will also feature a solicitation of new app ideas in settings, allowing users to expressly tell us what apps they are currently paying for and via subscription, that they'd like to pay $.99 cent for instead. What core features they want in it, and to provide their email address to be notified when it becomes available for download.

Each app will have a dedicated landing page built and hosted online, SEO optimized. Detailing the android and ios app store links, reviews pulled into it, app product pages to market it. Furthermore these landing pages, will offer a plethora of free to use tools, decided via keyword analysis, to drive traffic to the websites. Free meditation timer, for example, a desktop version, allowing a user a no account needed meditation timer they can set and use, styled in the same way our app is. Then upon finishing each go a modal popup markets our app "start recording your progression for only $.99 cent now".
