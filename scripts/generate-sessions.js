Settle into a rhythm. The thinking mind may quiet as you become absorbed in the sound.\n\nAfter 10 minutes of chanting, let the sound fade but continue sitting in the vibrating silence. The echo of Om continues within you. Rest in that resonance before returning to ordinary consciousness.",

You don't have to fix it or push it away.\n\nRecognize common humanity: 'Suffering is part of life. Everyone feels this way sometimes.'

Speak as you would to a dear friend who was suffering.\n\nIf words feel hollow, simply stay with the warmth of your hands on your heart. Touch itself is healing. Presence is enough.\n\nWhen you're ready, take a deep breath, open your eyes, and continue your day with whatever has shifted.",

But tonglen transforms our relationship to suffering. By willingly taking in pain and sending out relief, we discover that we are bigger than our suffering.\n\nExpand to all beings who suffer in similar ways. Breathe in the suffering of the world.

Let's unlearn that.\n\nNow, consciously breathe so that your belly hand rises while your chest hand stays relatively still. This means you're engaging your diaphragm fully.\n\nThe inhale should feel like a balloon inflating in your belly. The exhale, the balloon deflating. The chest moves very little. This is how babies breathe, how we breathed before stress taught us otherwise.\n\nPractice for 10 minutes, simply belly breathing. It may feel strange at first.

The simplicity of the structure makes it easy to notice when you've drifted.\n\nAfter 10 minutes, let the counting go and breathe naturally. Notice how you feel.

Watch it closely.\n\nNotice: the sensation is not static. It fluctuates. It intensifies or fades. It moves. If you watch long enough, it changes completely or disappears.\n\nThis is impermanence at the level of moment-to-moment experience. Everything is in flux. Nothing stays the same.\n\nNow expand your observation. Notice sounds arising and passing. Thoughts arising and passing. Emotions arising and passing. Everything comes and goes.\n\nThis insight, deeply felt, can be liberating. We suffer because we try to hold onto pleasant experiences and push away unpleasant ones. But nothing can be held.

We automatically grasp at pleasant, push away unpleasant, and ignore neutral. These reactions happen before conscious thought.\n\nBy bringing awareness to vedana, we create a gap between stimulus and response. We see the pleasant and can choose not to grasp.
