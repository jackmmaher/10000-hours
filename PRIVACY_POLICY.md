# Still Hours Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

Still Hours is a meditation timer app designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your meditation practice is personal, and your data should remain yours.

## Data We Collect

### Data Stored Locally (On Your Device)

- **Meditation sessions**: Start time, end time, duration
- **Practice preferences**: Theme, display settings, notification preferences
- **Insights and notes**: Any text you record after sessions
- **Hour bank balance**: Purchased hours and consumption tracking

This data is stored in your device's local storage (IndexedDB) and is **never transmitted to our servers** unless you explicitly choose to use community features.

### Optional Cloud Data (Only If You Sign In)

If you choose to sign in to access community features:

- **Email address**: Used for authentication only
- **Public pearls**: Insights you choose to share with the community
- **Profile statistics**: Aggregate counts (pearls created, karma received)

We use Supabase for authentication and community features. Their privacy policy applies to this data.

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do not use third-party analytics
- We do not track your location
- We do not access your contacts, photos, or other personal data
- We do not sell or share your data with advertisers
- We do not use cookies for tracking

## In-App Purchases

Hour pack purchases are processed through Apple's App Store or Google Play Store. We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. We receive:

- Transaction identifiers (to validate purchases)
- Product purchased and timestamp

We do NOT receive your payment information. That is handled entirely by Apple/Google.

## How We Use Your Data

1. **To provide the app**: Store your meditation history, track your progress toward 10,000 hours
2. **To process purchases**: Validate and fulfill hour pack purchases
3. **Community features**: Display shared pearls and calculate karma (only if you sign in)

## Data Retention

- **Local data**: Retained until you delete the app or clear app data
- **Cloud data**: Retained as long as you maintain an account. You can delete your account at any time.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Export your data**: Use the "Export Your Data" feature in Settings
- **Delete your data**: Uninstall the app to delete local data, or contact us to delete cloud data
- **Use the app anonymously**: Community features are optional; the core app works without signing in

## Children's Privacy

Still Hours is intended for users 13 years and older. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the app.
